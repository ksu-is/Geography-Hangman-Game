Repository for a Geography Hangman Game

This game tests your geograpphy knowledge with a hangman style game. You guess either a letter, or a full word, and the program checks it against the answer. The answer is randomly selected from a list of countries, and changes each round.

Hangman is such a popular game because it is simple enough that a child can play, but is as complex as whatever words the creater can think of. A geography game in this style will test your geography skills in a fun and interactive challenge.
